# Little Phoenix

TITLE: Little Phoenix

PROGRESS: Not complete / WIP

THEME: A Ruby on Rails app that catalogs purchases and sold items

IN DEPTH: I wanted to build a small app for my fiancee. She sells products to her friends back home and was using an excel spreadsheet. It was very hard to read entries on a mobile device, so I wanted to create a better solution for that.

TOOLS: Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, Ruby 2.7.0
